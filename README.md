# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I collected datasets from Gapminder. I chose the aid received per
person dataset from the economy section and the income per person dataset. I want to have a
glimpse of whether financial aid is really helping the receiving countries especially in Africa. I
explored the trends of how much aid per person an African country is receiving through the
years and how the income per person is changing, visualizing these with plots using matplotlib.
